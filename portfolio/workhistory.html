        <h1> Work History</h1>
        <p>Would you be surprised to learn that my first job was a cashier at McDonald's? The past six years I was waitressing in a large restaurant in Berlin. I loved how active the job was, having the day free was a blessing and the flexible work schedule allowed me to keep up with my lust for travel! </p>
        <p>I'm not getting any younger though! Last year I decided that a career change was in order. I gave programming a try. It's not my first dance with coding. That happened in UNI when Flash and Dreamweaver were all the rage. The fascination that seemingly 'text' would somehow produce a functional,  pretty webpage baffled me. Still does!</p>
        <p>I am still relatively new at all this, as you can see by my "creations" on this page! No judgement please! </p>
